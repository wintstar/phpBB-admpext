# AdminPlus emergency login

AdminPlus (ADMP) emergency login. This extension provides a random recognition key from your phpBB board. Also an emergency password for the founder. Only with these two keys can you log into the AdminPlus (ADMP) if the database fails. A link to the AdminPlus is inserted in the ACP.

**This expansion only works with AdminPlus**
